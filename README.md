## ðŸ—‚ Project Breakdown

### 1. React Client - Frontend

#### Description:
- In the left sidebar, there is a directory tree that expands all the folders inside on folder click and shows files stored in that folder on the right.
- There are clickable breadcrumbs on top, which show the current folder path.
- A new file/folder can be created in the selected folder by clicking the plus button on the top right.
- Plus button click opens a dropdown showing option to create a file or folder. After selecting file/folder a dialog pops-up.
- Clicking the file opens a dialog to update the content of that file.
- Users can search files in a folder (current directory or children directories) with file name or content.
- The lock button blurs and locks the screen, which can only be unlocked after the correct pin is entered. When the application is opened for the first time, the screen is locked by default.
